## Always Open an Issue

If you have an idea for a feature, you can potentially save yourself if time you first open an issue before writing code. I promise to review your ideas quickly to determine if it is appropriate for the community as a whole.

## Please Follow Some Basic Standards

- Please follow the **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** 
- Update the `README.md` whenever there are any changes in package behaviour.
- Clearly name your commits, and be sure to squash before submitting.
